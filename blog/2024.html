            <p>Got to see the legendary Alcione live at her beautiful and lively show. She's a queen!!</p>

            <p>Spent time with my dog, who I love so much ‚Äî even though he couldn‚Äôt care less about anyone in the family except my dad (who doesn‚Äôt even like him, lol). Okay, there were a few times he showed me some love. I know he loves me in his own way.</p>
        </div>

            <img src="../assets/images/blog/2024/bike.jpg">
            <p>Started cycling and discovered that I can reach places I never thought I‚Äôd have the energy to bike to.</p>
        </div>

            <img src="../assets/images/blog/2024/botw.jpg">
            <p>I beat the best game I‚Äôve ever played. While playing, I had so many moments like, 'OMG, is this really happening?' or 'Okay, that‚Äôs now my favorite part of the map.' The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was one of the first games I remember playing, and the series has a special place in my heart. <b>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</b> just made that love even stronger.</p>

            <img src="../assets/images/blog/2024/brothers.jpg">
            <p>Reunited with my brothers. We make such a great squad. I‚Äôm sure our parents are proud. Love you, bros! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

            <img src="../assets/images/blog/2024/emicida.jpg">
            <p>Went to another amazing show! I‚Äôm not really a concert person, but I really enjoyed this one‚Äîespecially when I sang QUEM TEM UM AMIGO TEM TUDO (who has a friend has everything) out loud while hugging my friends. Thank you, Emicida!!</p>

            <img src="../assets/images/blog/2024/car2.jpg">
            <p>Finally got my driver‚Äôs license!!! I never thought I‚Äôd drive a car one day, not because I didn‚Äôt feel capable, but it was never something I wanted. This year, I decided it could be a useful skill, so I took the classes. The process was super tiring, but I‚Äôm really glad I achieved this. It‚Äôs probably the highlight of 2024. The downside? Now I have even more reasons to HATE the traffic where I live.</p>

        <div class="post" id="11">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/2024/floripa.jpg">
            <p>And even after getting my driver‚Äôs license, I still took the bus a lot, but at least I could just focus on enjoying the view.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="post" id="12">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/2024/gym.jpg">
            <p>Developed a new habit and became a person I never thought I‚Äôd be: a gym girl!! There was a time I woke up at 5am just to hit the gym before work‚Äîcan you believe that? Me neither! I don‚Äôt do that anymore, but I still go to the gym at a normal time, lol.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="post" id="13">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/2024/lake.jpg">
            <p>Discovered new places, like the Botanical Garden.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="post" id="14">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/2024/passion.jpg">
            <p>Got my personal passion fruit tree! It‚Äôs probably my favorite fruit, and I was lucky enough to watch every flower turn into a fruit throughout the year. Plus, I discovered my new favorite cake: chocolate cake with passion fruit mousse.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="post" id="15">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/2024/pizza.jpg">
            <p>I spent a lot of time with myself and realized I really really really enjoy my own company. Am I going to become even more anti-social than I already was?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="post" id="16">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/2024/sapucai.jpg">
            <p>I went to Rio‚Äôs Carnival and watched the Samba School Parades for the second time. No words for that. I love you, Rio! I love you!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

        <div class="post" id="17">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/2024/stardew.jpg">
            <p>Completed the Stardew Valley story. I didn‚Äôt even know that was possible! Had so many great times playing this game before bed or on weekends, and created a really beautiful farm.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="post" id="18">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/2024/youtube.jpg">
            <p>Created a YouTube channel and uploaded two videos. I really love having those two memories to revisit sometimes. I wish I had more focus to create more, but the editing part was really tough for me. Hoping to make another two videos next year! üòÖ</p>
